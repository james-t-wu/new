                    <p>On 30th September 2025, HoneyBook, an AI-powered customer relationship management platform based in the United States, announced the acquisition of Fine.dev, a startup specializing in AI-assisted coding and rapid application development. The transaction amount has not been disclosed.</p>
                    <p>Fine.dev is an AI application development platform for developers and non-developers, helping users build and launch various web applications within minutes. The platform supports creating AI agents, SaaS products, internal tools, real-time chat applications, and personalized efficiency tools. Fine.dev provides complete backend solutions and has pioneered the innovative "Vibe Coding" approach that can transform business ideas into working software prototypes within minutes, significantly accelerating the software product development process.</p>
                    <p>As a leading AI-powered business management platform for small business owners, HoneyBook launched AI features in March 2025. The platform has performed excellently, with user project bookings increasing 2.5 times and saving over 20 hours of administrative work per week.</p>
                    <p>This acquisition brings professional AI technical support to HoneyBook's product development, enabling faster deployment of personalized tools and workflows.

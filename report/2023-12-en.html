                    <p>On December 24, 2023, Calcalist reported that Mend.io acquired the Israeli cybersecurity company Atom Security. The acquisition amount is approximately several million dollars.</p>
                    <p>Atom Security was founded in early 2023 and focuses on cyber risk assessment.</p>

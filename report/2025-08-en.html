                    <p>On August 28, 2025, SailPoint (NYSE: SAIL) announced the acquisition of core assets from SaaS security solution provider Savvy Security, with the transaction amount undisclosed. Savvy Security specializes in SaaS application visualization and monitoring solutions, with advanced technical capabilities in stealth IT detection and real-time risk assessment.

                    <p>On August 26, 2025, identity and access management solution provider Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) agreed to acquire Israeli startup Axiom for $100 million. Founded in 2021, Axiom specializes in developing innovative identity-based permission and access management platforms for cloud environments, SaaS applications, and databases. Okta focuses on identity and access management solutions.

By integrating Axiom's technology, Okta will enhance zero trust security principle implementation through advanced just-in-time access management and least privilege protocols. This acquisition particularly strengthens Okta's privileged access management products, enabling organizations to enhance security infrastructure while maintaining operational efficiency. Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a security framework for controlling and monitoring access to critical systems and sensitive information by users with elevated privileges. PAM solutions help organizations enforce security policies, reduce the risk of unauthorized access, and maintain compliance by implementing session recording, password management, and access control measures. Zero Trust Security is a cybersecurity model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device attempting to access organizational resources, whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.</p>
